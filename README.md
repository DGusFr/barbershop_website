# barbershop_website
Hello, this is the first website!
I created using HTML and CSS, for this first project I decided to make a website for a generic barbershop, in the most optimized way possible, always keeping a nice look, my code is already ready to be implemented and even be viewed on mobile phones.

I put as many annotations as possible in the code to help those who are starting in html and Front-end, feel free to implement the code ðŸ™‚
